# RFID_Blynk
RFID sensor connection project with Bylynk system 
This work aims to develop an algorithm considering the use of RFID technology in the context of automatic parcel categorisation based on the Arduino Uno microcontroller.
The C++ language, Ethernet shield, RC522 module, servo motor, stepper motor, BLYNK web application will be used to realise the objective. For the developed solution,
a 3D mock-up will be designed in the software and the resulting model will be printed on a 3D printer.
